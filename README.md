# Loan_Predictor

I use statistical modeling to build a classification model that determines whether a home loan will be approved based on given features. I use exploratory analysis to preprocess the data for logistic regression and determine which features are most important to include in the model. I use Pythons Pandas, Scikit learn, and Matplotlib libraries in my work.
