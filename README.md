# Loan_Predictor

Automating loan approvals can be a great way for banks to reduce work loads and increase efficency. It would also be a great tool to provide potential applicants in order for them to check whether a loan will be approved or even display what factors they can work on to improve their chances of getting a loan appproved.

I use statistical modeling to build a classification model that determines whether a home loan will be approved based on given features. I use exploratory analysis to preprocess the data for logistic regression and determine which features are most important to include in the model. I use Pythons Pandas, Scikit learn, and Matplotlib libraries in my work.
